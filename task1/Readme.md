The *Answer.pdf* file is a sample of what I would expect to find in a defect report. 
For most bugs I'd be looking for 'Actions to reproduce', 'Expected' and 'Actual', but that could be considered redundant 'noise' in this case as 
this is simply a relay of the output of an analysis tool.

(I've made the report a .pdf on this occasion so the formatting would hold between different systems - 
my Linux word processor sometimes formats differently to OSX. 
In 'real life' this would be an editable entity in something like JIRA or another defect tracking system.)
