Task 1 (Exploratory testing + bug reporting):

Your first task is to find a bug on any website on the internet and create a bug report out of it. The more severe the bug is the better, the more famous the site is the better. No worries, thereâ€™s a ton of bugs out there waiting for you! If you want, you can try with our own sites:
www.badoinkvr.com

www.wellhello.com

www.seekverify.com
