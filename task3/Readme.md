# Pre requisites
Node 6+ must be installed.

# Execution
```
npm install
npm test
```

# Notes
The tests are described in `tests.json` and can be added to simply. The automation script here is very simple (it was just the easiest way to run multiple api tests), but will run the tests asynchronously for speed and can be built upon if need be (to inlude proper reporting etc...).
