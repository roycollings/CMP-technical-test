1. Ensure the MyPrivateKey.key file has the correct permissions by running this command:

    chmod 600 MyPrivateKey.key

    (you could use 400 as well - as long as only the 'user' can access the file, not 'group' or 'all')

2. Run the following command to connect to the server:

    ssh -i MyPrivateKey.key root@45.65.34.23

3. Once in, type:

    cd /var/logs

4. The type:

    tail -30 super-app.log
